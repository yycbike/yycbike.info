# Looking at cycle track numbers

<div id='example'>

## Budget

The budget of the Cycle Track was set at $7,100,000<a href="#citation_final_project"><sup>1</sup></a>. The current spending according to the City of Calgary has been <span data-var="cost_of_cycletrack" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-format="dave_dollars" data-min="5e6" data-max="1e9" data-step="5e4"></span>, which is <span data-var="percentage_of_pilot_budget" data-format="percent"></span> of the cycle track budget

If you look at the <span data-var="trips" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1e6" data-max="1e9" data-step="1e4">&nbsp;trips done over the lifespan of the cycle track pilot project</span>, you can see that this comes to $<span data-var="cost_per_trip" data-format="%.2f"></span> spent per trip.

## Safety

When the pilot started, the average collisions per year was <span data-var="y2014_benchmark_collisions_per_year" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="800" data-step="1"></span>. Since the track has been put in place, there is now <span data-var="y2016_collisions_per_year" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="800" data-step="1"></span><a href="#citation_final_project"><sup>1</sup></a>. Assuming a cost to the city of <span data-format="dollars" data-var="cost_per_collision" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1e4" data-max="1e6" data-step="1e4"></span><a href="#cost_per_collision"><sup>2</sup></a>, this comes to a savings of $<span data-var="total_cost_of_collisions"></span> per year.

## Comparisons
Assuming airport tunnel construction costs came to <span data-var="cost_of_airport_tunnel" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-format="dollars" data-min="25e7" data-max="1e9" data-step="5e5"></span><a href="#exact_numbers"><sup>2</sup></a>. Assuming the same dollar-per-trip construction value,<a href="#apples_to_oranges"><sup>3</sup></a> you would see <span data-var="num_airport_tunnel_trips" data-format="%.1f"></span> trips, or roughly <span data-var="airport_tunnel_trips_per_day" data-format="%.1f"></span> trips/day.<a href="#no_numbers_available"><sup>4</sup></a>
