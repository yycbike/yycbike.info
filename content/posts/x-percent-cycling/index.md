Cycling is not considered a primary mode of transit for the majority of
Calgarians as of this writing, so it can be a little hard envisioning a
situation where that might actually be the case. However, the one constant we
can count on is change, and there may well be a time in the future where the
majority of Calgarians are on bikes.

In 2013, cycling infrastructure got 1.1% of the budget, and had 1.3% ride share.
